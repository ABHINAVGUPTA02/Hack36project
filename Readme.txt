INTRO OF THE PROJECT: the  basic theme of our web-app is “education”. The  onset of the global pandemic has speeded things a little bit. 
                      Schools and educational institutions have been transforming digitally over the past few years. Online study materials and online 
resources are a great advantage of technology in education.one of the main benefit of e-study materials is that students can access the information
anytime they want from anywhere.
